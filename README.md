RapidSmith is a research-based, open source FPGA CAD tool written in Java for modern Xilinx FPGAs. Based on XDL, its objective is to serve as a rapid prototyping platform for research ideas and algorithms relating to low level FPGA CAD tools.

The development of RapidSmith was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation Under Grant No. 0801876 as a part of the CHREC Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing.
